lamp-index
==========

A package that provides a Dashboard type interface for a lamp index.php file. You'll need to put the files in the root of your www folder, it will then provide links to the external site and the wp-admin of each site in your www folder. Currently this works with WordPress sites, would like to work on adding an auto detection for Drupal at some point.
